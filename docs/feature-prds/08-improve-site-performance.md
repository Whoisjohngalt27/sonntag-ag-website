## Problem Statement

The site has some performance issues and could benefit from optimization. Current implementation may have slower loading times, poor Core Web Vitals scores, and suboptimal user experience, leading to potential SEO penalties and reduced user engagement.

## Impact Analysis

### Business Impact
- **SEO Penalties:** Poor performance affects search rankings
- **User Abandonment:** Slow loading leads to higher bounce rates
- **Conversion Loss:** Poor performance reduces conversion rates
- **Brand Perception:** Slow site appears unprofessional

### User Impact
- **Poor User Experience:** Slow loading frustrates users
- **Mobile Issues:** Poor mobile performance affects mobile users
- **Accessibility Problems:** Performance issues affect all users
- **Engagement Loss:** Users may abandon slow-loading pages

### Technical Impact
- **Core Web Vitals:** Poor scores affect SEO and user experience
- **Mobile Performance:** Suboptimal mobile experience
- **Resource Usage:** Inefficient resource loading and caching
- **Monitoring Gaps:** Limited performance visibility

## Solution Overview

Implement comprehensive performance optimizations including image optimization, code splitting, caching strategies, CDN integration, and performance monitoring to achieve fast loading times and excellent Core Web Vitals scores.

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. Image Optimization
- **Compression:** Optimize image file sizes
- **Format Selection:** Use modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
- **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading for images
- **Responsive Images:** Serve appropriate sizes for devices
- **CDN Integration:** Use CDN for image delivery

### 2. Code Splitting and Bundling
- **Route-based Splitting:** Split code by page routes
- **Component Lazy Loading:** Load components on demand
- **Bundle Analysis:** Analyze and optimize bundle sizes
- **Tree Shaking:** Remove unused code
- **Dynamic Imports:** Implement dynamic imports

### 3. Caching Strategies
- **Browser Caching:** Implement proper cache headers
- **Service Worker:** Add service worker for offline support
- **CDN Caching:** Optimize CDN caching policies
- **API Caching:** Cache API responses appropriately
- **Static Asset Caching:** Cache static assets effectively

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- **Core Web Vitals:** Monitor and optimize LCP, FID, CLS
- **Real User Monitoring:** Track actual user performance
- **Performance Budgets:** Set and enforce performance budgets
- **Alerting:** Set up performance alerts
- **Reporting:** Regular performance reports

## Acceptance Criteria

### Technical Requirements
- **Page Load Time:** < 3 seconds for all pages
- **Core Web Vitals:** LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- **Mobile Performance:** > 90% mobile performance score
- **Lighthouse Score:** > 90% overall score

### Performance Metrics
- **First Contentful Paint:** < 1.5 seconds
- **Largest Contentful Paint:** < 2.5 seconds
- **Cumulative Layout Shift:** < 0.1
- **Time to Interactive:** < 3.5 seconds
